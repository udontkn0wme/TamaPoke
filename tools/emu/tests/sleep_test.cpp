// Putting the device down must not cost you the creature.
//
// A player left the board running overnight with the pet awake and came back to
// a Dratini that had run away. That was reachable because the LIVE tick is the
// only drain path with no floor: offline floors at 15, asleep floors at 30/35/45
// and skips the neglect check entirely, but a board left RUNNING took an awake
// creature to zero on all four stats in 100 minutes and to the point of running
// away in 160.
//
// Auto-sleep needs BOTH the screen off and the night window (00:00-06:00).
// Screen-off alone paused the game whenever the device was put down, and the
// creature is meant to get hungry during the day. The hour alone sent it to bed
// while somebody was still playing with it.
